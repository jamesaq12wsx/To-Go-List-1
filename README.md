#To-Go-List repo

A final project for the class Mobile Application Programming.
We did our final presentation at 6/16.

After the version we gave our presentation with, we have being still working on this APP.
And the problem is that the versions after spcific commit have some major issues not solved yet.


So we tagged the version that can work well "ON PHONE(4.7-inch)" as we did at presentation with the tag "final-ready"(27958c2).

Probably it is that we tried to add section to our tableviewlist introduced bugs into our code.

Our working on notification function is on going at branch "notification" and still has bug to fix for now.

An implementation of "Route", which was not demonstrated at presentation, is at [here](https://github.com/ssiang1627/To-Go-List). But scince it is based on the newest commit in master(which is problematic), It may work not well.
